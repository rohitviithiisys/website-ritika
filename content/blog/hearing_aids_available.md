So why would I even consider the Hearing Aids from HearClear?

We get this question a lot, so We thought of settling the debate! What you get for 2,999 from Amazon is not exactly a digital hearing aid, but an amplifier. A digital Hearing Aid is a high-tech medical device which customises the sound experience as per the user's hearing loss.

Over the counter (OTC) hearing aids are a cheaper alternative, but they come with a factory setting and usually provide little amplification which is suitable only for people with a perceived mild to moderate hearing loss. Buying an OTC without determining the hearing levels will not provide any benefit and mislead a person into believing that hearing aids do not work at all! The sound quality of these OTC aids is poor when compared to digital hearing aids. OTC hearing aids completely skips visiting the audiologist for assessment of hearing loss and thus mostly results in missing out the underlying cause of the hearing loss such as middle ear infections, restricted mobility of ear ossicles, pseudo tumors etc.
